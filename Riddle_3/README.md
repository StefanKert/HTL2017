# Riddle 3 - Anagram Checker

This is the last riddle for now. You do not need to provide a coded solution. It is sufficient to provide a description of the steps to take to solve the problem described underneath.

> Two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters with the exact same frequency (for example, "name" and "mean" are anagrams, but "red" and "deer" are not).
Given two strings S1 and S2, which each only contain the lowercase letters a through z, provide a solution on how to determine if S1 and S2 are anagrams.
