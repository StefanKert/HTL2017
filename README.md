This website provides information for the riddles that should be solved during Infoday 2017 at the _HTL_. You can fork this repository and provide the solution through a pull request, or you can discuss the solution with us directly! You can provide the solution either in pseudo code or in a language of your choice.

## We are looking forward to receive your solutions and to talk to you!!


# Riddle 1 - Crazy Counter

The first riddle is pretty easy. You need to complete the code underneath to print all numbers from 1 - 100. You do have to start with the code provided here:


```markdown
for (int i = 100; 
```

# Riddle 2 - FizzBuzz

The second riddle is kind of difficult but should also not be a big obstacle for you. 

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print **Fizz** instead of the number and for the multiples of five print **Buzz**. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print **FizzBuzz**.


# Riddle 3 - Anagram Checker

This is the last riddle for now. You do not need to provide a coded solution. It is sufficient to provide a description of the steps to take to solve the problem described underneath.

> Two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters with the exact same frequency (for example, "name" and "mean" are anagrams, but "red" and "deer" are not).
Given two strings S1 and S2, which each only contain the lowercase letters a through z, provide a solution on how to determine if S1 and S2 are anagrams.
